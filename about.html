            <h2 class="about-featurette-heading">My Education. <span class="about-secondary-text">A Journey from Musician to Young Professional</span></h2>
            <p class="about-lead">Originally starting college as a music education major, my journey to where I am today has been nothing short of interesting.</p>
            <p class="about-lead">I attended the University of Houston from Fall 2018 - December 2021. Within that time, I studied theory, marched in a myriad of football games, became a member of Sigma Alpha Iota Music Fraternity, and was a flute teacher to many students across various schools.</p>
            <p class="about-lead">During the COVID-19 pandemic, my gears shifted and I began becoming more interested in business. I transitioned to a Bachelor of Arts in Music & tacked on a Business Minor.</p>
            <p class="about-lead">Since then, I have graduated and continue to grow in my business leadership skills and learn about business functionality and technology.</p>

            <p class="about-lead">Ever since I was a child, fitness has always been a crucial part of my life and hobbies. My first love of sports came from Tae-Kwon-Do. I practiced for about 7 years as a child into my teens, finally ranking up to a black belt.</p>
            <p class="about-lead">Although continuing fitness in other ways, within the past year I have taken on a new adventure: climbing.</p>
        <p class="about-lead">I now continue to boulder and top rope climb with my friends as often as I can. Always pushing myself as well as the others around me.</p>
        <p class="about-lead">Next climbing goal? Climb outside! Stay tuned...</p>

          <p class="about-lead"> Since becoming an adult, I love traveling! I have been to many U.S states on vacation, lived in Arizona temporarily post-grad, and continue to make memories in Texas and beyond. </p>
          <p class="about-lead">I am also no stranger to solo travel, hiking, and National Parks. Ask me about my favorite hikes!</p>

        <p class="about-lead"> Have you ever heard of sillier names for pets?</p>
        <p class="about-lead">Hamlet is my beautiful russian blue cat that I adopted on my birthday in 2019. Since then, he has been a true character and joy to have in my life. Although sometimes he does act like a moody teenager!</p>
        <p class="about-lead">Unfortunately I can not take credit for my dog's name (Rooster), but I have never met an animal more fitting for his title. I adopted him during the early COVID-19 pandemic, and since then we have enjoyed years of cuddles, play time, and traveling.</p>
        <p class="about-lead">Fun Fact: Rooster is an international traveler!</p>
